# JaozinhoDoDegrade

One of my first and favourite Unity 2D Projects.

(At the time, I didn't even know how to Git, so I used to just zip everything of my Versions in a file and threw on my repo.)

This project includes illustrations, scripts and animations, all done by myself.
I used Adobe Illustrator to draw my sprites, separately, and Anima2D plugin to animate my characters inside Unity.

It already has life system, damages and enemies. This project showed me how fun can game development be, but the attention to details is something that almost drove me mad, causing a lot of GAMBIARRAS.
